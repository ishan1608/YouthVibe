Once upon a time, there was a warrior. He was brave. He was the bravest of all. He feared nothing. And he loved his horse. He loved his horse so much, that  he simply couldn't leave it filthy.<br/><br/>As it happens with every little warrior in our stories. Our warrior was also called upon by the king to go to the war and defend the country.<br/>Our Warrior was pleased, hence finally his duty has called. --></p>
